/**
 * The effect of Pawn Ticket fits very well one of a consumable item, but didn't work this way in the original game.
 * Instead, a story flag was set when using it, preventing from using it ever again if we were to find another one
 * (which was not possible in the vanilla game).
 *
 * This function kills two birds with one stone, both making it consumable and removing that flag check.
